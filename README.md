# 1D finite elements analysis

This repository contains a Java implementation of a 1D finite element solver. The code is designed to solve linear elasticity problems in which the stress and strain tensors are related by Hooke's law.

The solver uses a nodal-based approach to discretize the domain into a series of elements, each defined by two nodal points. The code includes functions for generating different types of elements: bar, beam, frame.

The code is written in Java and can be easily integrated into other Java projects. The code is well-documented and includes an .txt example of how to use the solver to solve problems.

Contributions to the code are welcome, and suggestions for improvements or additional features are encouraged..
